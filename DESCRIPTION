Description: Scrape and process play by play data from the NFL website. The data is formatted into a table
    containing a record of the individual players involved and the statistics accrued on every play that is
    available from the NFL. This allows for easier and quicker analysis of the play by play data than is
    possible with the nested list JSON structure provided by the NFL.This package largely mirrors the
    functionality of the nflscrapR package (https://github.com/maksimhorowitz/nflscrapR) but offers a
    significant speedup in the processing time. Going forward, this project will likely diverge from NFLScrapR's
    functionality and formatting.
